Introduction
Introduction into the topic of the thesis
Narrowing down the task
Answers to the questions: Why is the thesis useful? What is the goal of the work?
Determine and discussion of the starting point
What relevant methods/techniques are already developed in this research area (literature research)?
Which conditions (for implementation: hardware and software among others) exist?

Development of a (formal) solution model
Critical evaluation of the literature: What can be used?
Starting from the previous item, a concept for solving the task has to be developed

Justification of the solution concept: Comparision to alternatives!
This section must not include implementation details.

Implementation of the solution concept
Selection of tools (e.g. programming language)

Documentation of important design decisions
Critical evaluation of the implementation (test runs with measured run times, case study if possible, gaps in the implementation, useful future addtions,...)

Conclusion

Summary: What are the important results?

Future work: What can/must be done?
